Advanced Features
=================

ArgoBEAST has been built with a "tester first" philosophy. The intention is to take the focus away from writing boilerplate code and have more time writing tests. 

Whilst you can spend time writing complex code, there are some useful advanced features included in ArgoBEAST that should save you time.
